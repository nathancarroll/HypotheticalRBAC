# HypotheticalRBAC

## Task

## Suggested implementation


## Questions to resolve
- Email server details. Are we using outgoing emails anywhere else in the application, or just for new registrations and password resets?
- Password requirements
- How should new admin users be registered?
- Postman team or shared collections? Or other API test application?
- Other admin actions aside from listing users?
